    h3(class='page-title', id='scroll_up') What is Responsive Web Design?
      
    p At its simplest, a responsive website adapts to the screen size of the visitor. It doesn't matter if the site visitor is using a Mac, a PC, a tiny mobile device, or a massive wide-screen; Windows, OSX, or Linux — responsive websites are device agnostic.

    h3(class='page-title', id='scroll_up') Why choose Responsive Web Design?
    
    p More and more people these days are turning to their mobile devices to search for business and product information, so your old site may not be working for you as well as it could.
    
    p Responsive design allows your site to work across a range of devices, from small to large without losing any of it's visual appeal or organizational integrity. Not only is this important for branding purposes, but it also ensures that your customers get the information they are looking for efficiently.
